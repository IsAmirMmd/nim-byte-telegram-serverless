description: Build, add or update a Telegram Mini App hosted on Telegram Serverless (tgcloud) — the front-end build served at app<id>.tgcloud.ai, its server side as tgcloud/endpoints/<name>.js (POST /api/<name>), calls via Telegram.WebApp.Serverless.call, the tgcloud.jsonc "static" config (source, spa, immutable, headers, redirects), and build + deploy. Use whenever the user wants to create, implement, change, debug or deploy a serverless Mini App, web app or endpoint for a tgcloud bot.

# tgcloud Mini App

A Mini App on Telegram Serverless is two halves deployed together by `npx tgcloud push`:

| Half | Lives in | Runs | Can use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Front-end | project root (Vite/React/Vue/…), build → `dist/` | the user's browser in Telegram | npm packages, `window.Telegram.WebApp` |
| Endpoints | `tgcloud/endpoints/<name>.js` | the platform's V8 isolate | `sdk` only: `db`, `api`, `fetch`, `EndpointError` |

The front-end never imports `tgcloud/` code. It talks to the server **only** through endpoints. Site URL: `https://app<app_id>.tgcloud.ai/` (`push` prints it). Endpoints answer `POST /api/<name>` on the same host.

Source: https://core.telegram.org/bots/serverless#mini-app-front-end. Re-check it with WebFetch if something here doesn't match the CLI's behavior.

Something small that should live **inside a message** (a counter, a poll, a
price, a code to copy) is a widget (Bot API 10.4), not a Mini App. Use the
`tgcloud-widgets` skill. A widget can open the Mini App with
`openTelegramLink('https://t.me/<bot>/<app>')`.

## Step 1: Inspect the project

- Is there a `tgcloud/` folder? If not, set up the bot first (the `tgcloud-bot` skill, or `npm create @tgcloud/bot .`). Read the project's `AGENTS.md`, since it holds the module rules.
- Is there a front-end? Look at `package.json`, `vite.config.*` and `index.html`. If there's none, create one at the **project root**, next to `tgcloud/`, keeping the existing files.
- Check `tgcloud.jsonc` → `"static"`.

**The front-end is always React (Vite + `@vitejs/plugin-react`).** Never write a vanilla-JS UI. Its look follows the design system the user chose (Step 1b, `docs/DESIGN.md`). The default is Telegram's own theme: `telegram-web-app.js` sets `--tg-theme-*` CSS variables (bg, text, hint, link, button, section…) from the user's theme and keeps them updated, so the app looks native in light, dark and custom themes. The starter's `src/app.css` maps them to a few app variables with fallbacks for the browser. Write endpoints with the `tgcloud-endpoints` skill.

**Fastest start:** the tgcloud-bot scaffold with `--mini-app` copies the starter in [assets/app/](assets/app/):
- `index.html` and `vite.config.js`;
- `src/main.jsx` (ready, expand, fullscreen, close confirmation);
- `src/App.jsx` (calls `me`, shows the user's own profile, and a feedback form that calls the `feedback` endpoint with loading and error states);
- `src/app.css` (the Telegram theme variables, safe areas, sections, rows, inputs, buttons);
- `src/lib/` (`serverless.js`, `useEndpoint.js`, `telegram.js` with theme following, haptics and native dialogs, `format.js`);
- `tgcloud/endpoints/feedback.js` (validated, throttled), with `test/miniapp.test.mjs`.

There is no admin panel in the starter. When the user asks for one, build it from the tgcloud-bot skill's `references/admin-tools.md` §3 (`requireAdmin` first in every admin endpoint).

With the bot already scaffolded:

`node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../tgcloud-bot/scripts/scaffold.mjs" . --admin <ADMIN_ID> --mini-app`

The scaffold adds only the missing files. Build new pages on that starter rather than from scratch.

## Step 1b: Design system

`docs/DESIGN.md` is the project's design choice. If it records a choice the user made, follow it for every UI change and don't ask again. If it is missing, or still says **"Chosen by the user: not yet"** (the scaffold's default), **ask which design system to use**, as a choice:

- **Default**: Telegram's own theme. Nothing to provide.
- **My own design system**: they type or link it. In Claude Code, AskUserQuestion with these two options; the free-text answer carries the details.

**Default.** Keep `src/app.css` as it is. New components use only its variables (`--bg`, `--section-bg`, `--text`, `--hint`, `--link`, `--button`, `--button-text`, `--destructive`, `--separator`, `--section-title`, `--radius`), never hard-coded colors. In `docs/DESIGN.md`, change "Chosen by the user: not yet" to "Chosen by the user: yes" (or write the file from the scaffold's version if it's missing).

**Their own.** Turn what they gave into tokens, then wire them in:
1. **Read the source.**
   - A website or brand guide: WebFetch it and take the colors, fonts, sizes, radii, shadows and spacing from its CSS.
   - Figma: use the Figma tools if they're connected; otherwise ask for exported tokens or screenshots.
   - A CSS or tokens file: copy it into `src/styles/`.
   - An installed design-system skill: load it and follow it.
   - A UI library: `npm i` it in the front-end only (never in `tgcloud/`) and follow its setup for Vite + React.
   - A description: turn it into a small palette and type scale, and show it to the user before building on it.
   Ask for whatever is missing (a dark-mode palette, the font's license) instead of guessing.
2. **One token file.** Put the tokens on `:root` in `src/styles/design.css`, plus a dark set under `:root[data-theme='dark']` (`useTelegramTheme` sets `data-theme` from `Telegram.WebApp.colorScheme`). Import it in `src/main.jsx` before `app.css`.
3. **Map the app variables** in `src/app.css` (`--bg`, `--text`, `--button`, …) to the new tokens, so the existing components switch over at once. Then restyle components in the new language: borders, shadows, radii, spacing.
4. **Fonts**: self-host them in `src/fonts/` (or load them from a CDN) with a system fallback. Persian UI needs a font with Persian glyphs.
5. **Keep the Mini App rules**: `dir="rtl"` / logical properties, the safe-area padding on `.app`, tap targets of at least 44px, readable contrast in both themes. Pass the design's background as a hex color to `setHeaderColor` / `setBackgroundColor` in `src/lib/telegram.js`.
6. **Don't copy someone else's brand** (logo, name, paid fonts) unless the user owns it or its license allows it.
7. **Save it**: rewrite `docs/DESIGN.md` with the source, the tokens, the fonts and the component rules, so later sessions and other agents keep using it.
8. **Check it**: build, then screenshot at 390px wide in light and dark (see Step 5).

## Step 2: Wire the front-end

0. React setup in an existing project: `npm i react react-dom` and `npm i -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react`. Then add `vite.config.js` with `plugins: [react()]`, `index.html` with `<div id="root">` and `<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx">`, and the scripts `"dev": "vite"`, `"build": "vite build"`, `"deploy": "vite build && tgcloud push"`. Add `dist/` to `.gitignore`.
1. Add the Telegram script to `index.html` `<head>`, before the app bundle:
   `<script src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js"></script>`
2. Copy [assets/app/src/lib/serverless.js](assets/app/src/lib/serverless.js) to `src/lib/serverless.js` and [assets/app/src/lib/useEndpoint.js](assets/app/src/lib/useEndpoint.js) to `src/lib/useEndpoint.js`. The first turns `Serverless.call` into a promise (`await callEndpoint('getProfile', { lang: 'en' })`). The second is a React hook: `const { data, error, loading, reload } = useEndpoint('myOrders', { page, size })`. It refetches when the input changes and drops stale responses.
3. On startup: `Telegram.WebApp.ready(); Telegram.WebApp.expand();`. Use `Telegram.WebApp.themeParams` / CSS vars (`var(--tg-theme-bg-color)`) so the app matches the Telegram theme.
3a. Fullscreen and close confirmation (the starter's `src/main.jsx` does both):
   ```js
   if (tg?.isVersionAtLeast?.('8.0') && !tg.isFullscreen) tg.requestFullscreen();   // fails → 'fullscreenFailed' event { error: 'UNSUPPORTED' | 'ALREADY_FULLSCREEN' }
   if (tg?.isVersionAtLeast?.('6.2')) tg.enableClosingConfirmation();               // "are you sure?" on close
   ```
   In fullscreen, Telegram's buttons overlay the page. Pad the top and bottom with `var(--tg-safe-area-inset-top, 0px) + var(--tg-content-safe-area-inset-top, 0px)` (and `-bottom`). `telegram-web-app.js` sets these variables, and they update on the `safeAreaChanged` / `contentSafeAreaChanged` events. Call `setHeaderColor` so the status bar stays readable. Also available: `exitFullscreen()`, `isFullscreen`, the `fullscreenChanged` event, and `disableClosingConfirmation()`. Docs: https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps
4. `initDataUnsafe` is for display only (name, photo). Anything that needs trust goes through an endpoint, which receives **verified** init data.
5. Keep the bundler's `base` at `/`. Never put files under `/api/` in the build output. Don't set `X-Frame-Options` or a restrictive `frame-ancestors`, because Telegram Web loads the app in an iframe.
6. **Same origin only** (Bot API 10.2, on for every Mini App since July 20, 2026): `Telegram.WebApp` methods work only from the Mini App's own origin, `https://app<app_id>.tgcloud.ai`. Keep every screen on that host. A page on another domain (an external checkout, a redirect, another site in an iframe) can't call them. Set exactly the URL that `push` printed in BotFather. BotFather can turn the protection off, but then the bot is responsible for the app linking to no untrusted site, so leave it on.

## Step 3: Configure static hosting (`tgcloud.jsonc`)

```jsonc
{
  "static": {
    "source": "dist",             // the build folder (Vite: dist). Next/Nuxt/SvelteKit/Angular: configure static export first
    "spa": true,                  // client-side routing: index.html for missing extension-less paths
    "immutable": ["/assets/*"],   // content-hashed files only → cached 1 year
    // "headers":   [{ "path": "/assets/*", "set": { "X-Foo": "bar" } }],   // exact path or prefix/*; null removes
    // "redirects": [{ "from": "/old", "to": "/new", "status": 301 }],       // first match wins; real files beat rules
  },
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@tgcloud/cli/schema/tgcloud.json"
}
```

`"static": "dist"` is shorthand for this. `"static": false` **deletes** the deployed site on the next push. Removing the key only stops managing it, and the deployed site stays. Use either `tgcloud.jsonc` or `tgcloud.json`, never both.

## Step 4: Write endpoints

Scaffold: `npx tgcloud add endpoints/<name>`. Names use letters, digits and `_`, don't start with a digit, and the folder is flat (no subfolders).

```js
// tgcloud/endpoints/getProfile.js
import { db, EndpointError } from 'sdk';
import { eq } from 'sdk/db';
import { profiles } from '../schema.js';

export default async function (input, ctx) {
  const user = ctx.initData.user;              // verified by the platform; there is no ctx.user
  const profile = await db.select().from(profiles).where(eq(profiles.userId, user.id)).get();
  if (!profile) throw new EndpointError('Profile not found', { code: 'NO_PROFILE' });
  return profile;                              // sent back as JSON
}
```

Rules:
- **Identify the caller only from `ctx.initData.user.id`.** Never trust a user id sent in `input`.
- Refusals use `throw new EndpointError(description, { code })` → HTTP 400, and the client gets `err.message` and `err.parameters.code`. Any other throw becomes a generic 500, and its message never reaches the client.
- Bad or missing init data → 401 before your code runs.
- Validate `input` (types, lengths). It's arbitrary JSON from the client.
- Admin-only endpoints (only when the user asks for them) call `requireAdmin(ctx)` from `lib/access.js` first.
- Anything that sends messages, writes or costs money is throttled per user: every Mini App user can call every endpoint, in a loop.
- Shared logic goes in `tgcloud/lib/`, imported with relative paths that end in `.js`. The bot's handlers and the endpoints can share it.
- Every DB call is `await`ed. Schema changes go in `tgcloud/schema.js` and then `npx tgcloud migrate`.

More recipes (sending a message from the app, upserting the user, pagination, errors in the UI): [references/recipes.md](references/recipes.md).

## Step 5: Test

- Endpoint logic, without deploying (`--ctx` isn't verified, so this tests your logic only):
  `npx tgcloud run endpoints/getProfile '{}' --ctx '{ initData: { user: { id: 1, first_name: "Ann" } } }'`
- Front-end layout: `npm run dev` in a browser works, but `Telegram.WebApp.Serverless` only works inside Telegram. The wrapper in `src/lib/serverless.js` rejects with `type: 'NOT_IN_TELEGRAM'` outside Telegram, and the starter shows a notice for it.
- Endpoints: `npm test` runs them offline on the mock SDK (see `test/miniapp.test.mjs`).
- Layout without Telegram: build, serve `dist/` with Playwright, and stub `window.Telegram.WebApp.Serverless.call` in an init script so it returns fixture data. Screenshot the result at 390px wide. For real calls, deploy and open the app in Telegram.

## Step 6: Build and deploy

`push` uploads the build folder **as it is on disk** and never builds. Always build first:

```
npm run deploy           # vite build → tgcloud push
npx tgcloud migrate      # when schema.js changed
```

`migrate --yes` applies every safe and warning schema change without asking. Changes that need manual handling are never applied automatically. Use `npx tgcloud migrate --dry-run` first if you aren't sure.

- `npx tgcloud push`: modules + static files (only changed files are uploaded).
- `npx tgcloud push dist/`: static files only. `npx tgcloud push tgcloud/endpoints/x.js`: that module only (leaves the site untouched).
- The kit's `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` already runs `npm run build --if-present` before `push`, and its `paths:` filter covers `src/`, `index.html` and `vite.config.*`.

## Step 7: Open it in Telegram

Copy the URL that `push` printed (`https://app<app_id>.tgcloud.ai/`) and set it in **BotFather** as the bot's Mini App / menu button URL. The Mini App files are also visible under **Serverless** in BotFather. Inline/keyboard buttons can open it too: `{ text: 'Open', web_app: { url } }`.

## Limits

Upload 50 MB per file (10 MB photo). `api.getFileContent`/`getFileStream` 20 MB. `fetch` response 30 MB. A batch insert is one statement, limited by SQLite's variable count (rows × columns). No foreign keys.
